Charter schools on average tend to have higher math and reading scores along with % of
student body who passes these courses and overall.

Larger schools see a steeper decrease in students passing math compared to medium and small schools. 
When spending is between $585-$630 per student, students tend to see the biggest benefits.

Charter schools tend to spend less per student and are more likely to be smaller. One interesting
thing to look at would be how big class sizes are in District vs Charter schools because I think 
there are more factors at play here than just spending per student.
